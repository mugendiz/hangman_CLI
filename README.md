* **Letter.js**: Contains a constructor, Letter. Displays an underlying character or a blank placeholder, depending on whether or not the user has guessed the letter. That means the constructor should define:

* **Word.js**: Contains a constructor, Word that depends on the Letter constructor. This creates an object representing the current word the user is attempting to guess.

* **index.js**: The file containing the logic for the course of the game, which depends on `Word.js`
